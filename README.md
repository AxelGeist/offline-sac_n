### Offline SAC_n for Four Rooms Env

This code adapts the CORL implementation of offline sac_n, found [here](https://github.com/tinkoff-ai/CORL?tab=readme-ov-file), to be used in environments with discrete actions.

To train, run:
```
python sac_n_discrete.py
```

The dataset used in training is generated by `fourrooms_dataset_gen.py`, which executes random actions in the four-rooms environment and records the in the d4rl dataset format. This dataset can be replaced by any dataset you like which follows the correct format.
